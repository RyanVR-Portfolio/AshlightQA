# AshlightQA
 The website project for AshlightQA.

 The plan:
 As a QA professional I've had 12 years of hard earned experience. Late nights, early mornings, and intense focus have resulted in breaking through bottlenecks and releasing five or more full fledged features per week.

 I feel that it's time to have my own consulting business. Leveraging my speed and professionalism in the field to quickly build STLC processes, documentation, and quickly grinding through features. 

 My focus is to service small companies, start-ups, and companies reeling from being made to lay off their entire QA workforce.
